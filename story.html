            <p>Growing up with autism, I struggled to communicate with others. Movies became a way for me to learn about “conversation,” as they depict real life issues. They helped me navigate feelings of confusion, sadness, and fear. I aspire to impact people through film, just as it has impacted me.</p>
            <p>I have spent three years in Sydney, two of which were dedicated to studying film at Sydney Film School. During my studies at the school, I earned a diploma and an advanced diploma. I was nominated by the school for Best Screenplay and Best Director twice, winning the Best Director award once. 
            My biggest and proudest achievement was being selected for the Talent to Watch program alongside six other participants from 2021 to 2022. This competition, made possible by the Swedish Film Institute, aimed to discover new talents.</p>
            <p>In Sweden, I have worked on films such as the Guldbagge Award-winning “Trädgårdsgatan/Garden Lane” and have worked as an assistant to line producer Thomas Nilsson throughout the entire production of the world renowned fourth season of “The Bridge.”</p> 
            <p>I’m currently a script editor/consultant for Callback. I believe I can offer a unique perspective as a screenwriter by drawing on the emotionally charged experiences from my upbringing, which can help others convey and manage emotions more effectively in their own scripts.</p>
